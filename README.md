# Deimos
This was mostly a personal challenge. I wanted to create a graphing calculator like Desmos using only the Win32 API entirely in C.

## Functionality
There's not much yet. It displays an empty sidebar and a graph that plots y=x.

## How to run
Run `a.exe`. Or if you want to recompile run the file called `r`.
